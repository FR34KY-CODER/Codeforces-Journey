![Codeforces Rating](https://github.com/FR34KY-CODER/Codeforces-Journey/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-07-07%20211546.png?raw=true)

**Disclaimer**: This is my personal archive of Codeforces solutions. Solutions are not organized by problem ID and may not be optimal. I can't guarantee their correctness for others' use.

## üìå Current Stats
- **Rating**: 1237 (Pupil)
- **Problems Solved**: 180+
- **Contests**: 21 rated (25 total)
- **Peak Performance**: Rank 3847 (Div. 3), 4 problems solved

## üóÇÔ∏è File Naming
Solutions are sequentially numbered as:
```
cf1.cpp
cf2.cpp
...
cf141.cpp
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. **No problem mapping** - Files aren't linked to specific problems
2. **Quality varies** - Early solutions may be inefficient
3. **Personal use** - Primarily for my own reference
4. **No support** - I can't help debug these for others

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Warning
If you still want to explore:
```bash
# Example compilation
g++ cf123.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

This repository documents my programming journey more than offering reusable solutions. For properly organized solutions, check other repositories.
